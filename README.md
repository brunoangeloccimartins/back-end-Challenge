# Movie Catalog API

## Introduction

The Movie Catalog API is a RESTful web service designed to manage a catalog of movies. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting movies, as well as user authentication using JWT tokens.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this application, you need to have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version X.X.X or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (if using Docker for development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brunoangeloccimartins/back-end-Challenge.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Using Docker Compose

If you have Docker Compose installed, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will build the Docker images for your application and its dependencies, and then start the containers.

#### Without Docker Compose

If you prefer not to use Docker Compose, you can run the application manually:

1. Start Redis and PostgreSQL using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up redis db
   ```

2. Start the Nest.js application:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

### Usage

You can make HTTP requests using your browser or applications like Insomnia. The API provides the following routes:

- **POST** `localhost:3000/user`: Register a new user.
- **POST** `localhost:3000/auth/login`: Authenticate with the credentials you created in the route above. After authentication:
  - Copy the received token.
  - Paste the token in the header authorization as Bearer Token.
  - With the token set up, you can access all movie routes.
- **POST** `localhost:3000/movies`: Create a new movie.
- **GET** `localhost:3000/movies`: Retrieve all movies.
- **PUT** `localhost:3000/movies/id`: Update a specific movie by its ID.
- **DELETE** `localhost:3000/movies/id`: Delete a specific movie by its ID.


### Documentation

The API documentation is generated using Swagger. You can access it by visiting:
